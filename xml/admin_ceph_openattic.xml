  <title>Technology Preview</title>
  <para>
   As of &storage; 3, &oa; is considered a technology preview and is not
   supported.

 <para>
  &oa; is a central storage management system which supports &ceph; storage
  cluster. With &oa; you can control everything from a central management
  interface. It is no longer necessary to be familiar with the inner
  workings of the &ceph; storage tools. Cluster management tasks can be
  carried out by either using &oa;'s intuitive Web interface, or via its
  REST API.

   <title>Installing Required Packages</title>
   <para>
    While you can install and run &oa; on any existing &ceph; cluster node,
    we recommend to install it on the admin node. &oa; is included in the
    &storage; extension. To install the required packages, run
   </para>
<screen>sudo zypper in openattic openattic-gui</screen>
   <tip>
    <para>
     &oa; will work correctly only if it is the only Web-based application
     on the specific host. Do not share the host with another Web
     application such as Calamari.
    </para>
   </tip>

  <sect2 xml:id="ceph.oa.install.oa">
   <title>&oa; Initial Setup</title>
   <para>
    After the packages are installed, run the actual &oa; setup:
   </para>
<screen>sudo oaconfig install</screen>
   <para>
    <command>oaconfig install</command> will start a number of services,
    initialize the &oa; database, and scan the system for pools and volumes
    to include.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="ceph.oa.install.user">
   <title>Create the <systemitem>openattic</systemitem> Superuser</title>
   <para>
    To manage &oa;, you need to create an administrative user account with
   </para>
<screen>sudo oaconfig createsuperuser</screen>
   <para>
    You can specify your own user name, or leave the default
    <systemitem>openattic</systemitem>.
   </para>
<!--
   <para>
    By default, <command>oaconfig</command> creates an administrative user
    account <systemitem>openattic</systemitem>, with the same password as
    the user name. As a security precaution, we strongly recommend to change
    this password immediately:
   </para>
<screen>sudo oaconfig changepassword openattic
Changing password for user 'openattic'
Password: &lt;enter password>
Password (again): &lt;re-enter password>
Password changed successfully for user 'openattic'
</screen>
-->
   <para>
    Now your &oa; storage system can be managed by the Web user interface.
   </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="ceph.oa.install.webui">
   <title>Accessing &oa; Web User Interface</title>
   <para>
    &oa; can be managed using a Web user interface. Open a Web browser and
    navigate to http://www.example.org/openattic. To log in, use the user
    name and password you specified in
    <xref linkend="ceph.oa.install.user"/>.
